# Coding Standards
standards:
  csharp:
    naming_conventions:
      class: "PascalCase"
      method: "PascalCase"
      variable: "camelCase"
      private_field: "_camelCase"
      constant: "PascalCase"
    
    patterns:
      - "Use Unity lifecycle methods appropriately (Awake, Start, Update, etc.)"
      - "Always specify access modifiers for methods (public, private, protected)"
      - "Use [SerializeField] only for Unity UI (uGUI) components"
      - "Use GetComponent<T>() wisely and cache references"
      - "Implement IDisposable for cleanup when needed"
      - "Use coroutines for time-based operations"

# AI Assistant Context
context:
  frameworks:
    - "Unity Engine"
    - "Unity UI (uGUI)"
    - "Unity Input System"
    - "TextMeshPro"
  
  common_patterns:
    - "MonoBehaviour components"
    - "ScriptableObject data containers"
    - "Singleton pattern for managers"
    - "Object pooling for performance"
    - "Event-driven architecture"
  
  best_practices:
    - "Avoid heavy operations in Update()"
    - "Use object pooling for frequently instantiated objects"
    - "Implement proper null checks"
    - "Use coroutines instead of Update() for delayed actions"
    - "Cache component references in Awake() or Start()"
    - "Use layers and tags for organization"

# Custom Instructions
custom_instructions: |
  When suggesting code for Unity:
  1. Always consider mobile performance implications
  2. Suggest appropriate Unity lifecycle methods
  3. Recommend using ScriptableObjects for game data
  4. Consider multiplayer implications if relevant
  5. Suggest proper error handling and null checks
  6. Use Unity's built-in systems when available
  7. Always include access modifiers for all methods
  8. Use PascalCase for constants
  9. Use [SerializeField] only for uGUI components
  10. Provide Korean comments for better understanding (한국어 주석 포함)
